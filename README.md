"Contract-Management-System" 

The Contract Management System (CMS) is a software solution designed to streamline and optimize the contract management process.
The primary objective of the system is to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and accountability of Revenue Expenditure and 
Capital Expenditure contract-related activities within the organization.
The proposed application allows users to input contract details through a user-friendly dashboard.
Additionally, the system will send timely email reminders for contracts that are approaching their expiration date within a 
three-month timeframe. This ensures that users stay informed and can take necessary actions in a timely manner for contract renewals or closure.
